security-app
============

This is a very basic webapp that locates IP addresses associated with 
Ransomware according to ransomwaretracker.com. As this is an ongoing project, 
the ultimate goal is to learn how to use Flask in Python and eventually master 
React.js to develop my skills in the full stack. Thus, I made this using 
Python3's Flask module and hope to render HTML components in React.js. Other 
components include Google Maps for Python.

Installation
------------

1. Make sure you have the latest versions of Python3 and React.js installed.
2. Clone this repo into your desired directory.
3. cd into the directory from Terminal.
4. Run the following:

```
$ pip3 install requirements.txt
```

Usage
-----

Run the following in the directory:

```
$ python3 app_main.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your favorite browser!

This is an open-source project relying on Flask, RansomwareTracker and Google Maps.
Special thanks to those three as well as StackOverflow for answering my 
miscellaneous questions as per usual.

Please cite anything that you use here.

Learning goals (for me!):
* How to use Flask
* Get accustomed to the full stack
* Extend these into my other personal projects

To fix in the future:
* Learn how to use Flask so I can style on a CSS sheet and put my scripts in the
/static folder
* Integrate React into this project
